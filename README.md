an example with troposphere to spin up a simple instance in amazon

This is part of a bigger effort, to have a remote work station, with some basics, fully automated.

1- something to provision a machine in AWS

2- something to run the ansible playbook as downloaded from the branch master of a repo

3- mount something like a filesystem with access to a cloud (dropbox, drive, whatever)

and give you the access details of such a thing. 

## Improvements

for now it just spins the instance. in the future, some static storage would be awesome
